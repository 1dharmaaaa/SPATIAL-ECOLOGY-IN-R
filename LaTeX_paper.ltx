\begin{abstract}

In the depth of my soul there is
A wordless song - a song that lives
In the seed of my heart.
It refuses to melt with ink on
Parchment; it engulfs my affection
In a transparent cloak and flows,
But not upon my lips.


How can I sigh it? I fear it may
Mingle with earthly ether;
To whom shall I sing it? It dwells
In the house of my soul, in fear of
Harsh ears.


When I look into my inner eyes
I see the shadow of its shadow;
When I touch my fingertips
I feel its vibrations.


The deeds of my hands heed its
Presence as a lake must reflect
The glittering stars; my tears
Reveal it, as bright drops of dew
Reveal the secret of a withering rose.


It is a song composed by contemplation,
And published by silence,
And shunned by clamor,
And folded by truth,
And repeated by dreams,
And understood by love,
And hidden by awakening,
And sung by the soul.


It is the song of love;
What Cain or Esau could sing it?


It is more fragrant than jasmine;
What voice could enslave it?


It is heartbound, as a virgin's secret;
What string could quiver it?


Who dares unite the roar of the sea
And the singing of the nightingale?
Who dares compare the shrieking tempest
To the sigh of an infant?
Who dares speak aloud the words
Intended for the heart to speak?
What human dares sing in voice
The song of God?

\section{Introduction}
In the depth of my soul there is
A wordless song - a song that lives
In the seed of my heart.
It refuses to melt with ink on
Parchment; it engulfs my affection
In a transparent cloak and flows,
But not upon my lips.


How can I sigh it? I fear it may
Mingle with earthly ether;
To whom shall I sing it? It dwells
In the house of my soul, in fear of
Harsh ears.


When I look into my inner eyes
I see the shadow of its shadow;
When I touch my fingertips
I feel its vibrations.


The deeds of my hands heed its
Presence as a lake must reflect
The glittering stars; my tears
Reveal it, as bright drops of dew
Reveal the secret of a withering rose.


It is a song composed by contemplation,
And published by silence,
And shunned by clamor,
And folded by truth,
And repeated by dreams,
And understood by love,
And hidden by awakening,
And sung by the soul.


It is the song of love;
What Cain or Esau could sing it?


It is more fragrant than jasmine;
What voice could enslave it?


It is heartbound, as a virgin's secret;
What string could quiver it?

Who dares unite the roar of the sea
And the singing of the nightingale?
Who dares compare the shrieking tempest
To the sigh of an infant?
Who dares speak aloud the words
Intended for the heart to speak?
What human dares sing in voice
The song of God?
\section{methods}
for this thesis, a formula is used.
\begin{equation}
F= G\frac{m1 m2}{d2}
F= G\frac{m_1 m_2}{d2}
F= G\frac{m_1 m_2}{d^2}
F= G\times\frac{m_1\times m_2}{d^2}
F= \sqrt{G\times\frac{m_1\times m_2}{d^2}}
F= \sqrt[3]{G\times\frac{m_1\times m_2}{d^2}}
\label{eqNewton}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a=b+c
\label{eqsum}
\end{equation}

starting from equation\ref{eqsum}
As we have seen in section \ref{secIntro} blalal
as we have seen in equation 1, so and so

\section{Results}
When I look into my inner eyes
I see the shadow of its shadow;
When I touch my fingertips
I feel its vibrations.
The final output will look like that of figure 1.

\section{Discussion}
The results found in this thesis are inline with previous experiments 

The main achievements of this thesis can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item graphical representation of species distributions
     \item statistical annalysis of uncertainity
      \item Lor on theme
    
\end{itemize}
We might alo make use of numbers

\begin{enumerate}
    \item graphical representaiont of species distributions
     \item statistical annalysis of uncertainity
      \item Lor on theme
\end{enumerate}
