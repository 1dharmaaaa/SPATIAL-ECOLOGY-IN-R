#the north west part has the highest varaiability

#instead of 3/3 calculate variability in 7/7 moving window

sd7 <- focal(nir, matrix(1/9, 7, 7), fun=sd)
plot(sd7)

#7/7 is more higher than 3/3 so more clearer pixels.

#exercise 2:plot via par(mfrow()) the 3x3 and the standard deviation

#if you calculate sd 3/3 moving window you will have a very local , subtle difference . if you enlarge the window youll enlarge it to 7/7 which is 49 instead of 9 that is why we have this effect we have higher variability
#since we are increasing additionally pixel we are increasing the variability

#original image plus the 7 x 7 sd
# original image plus the 7x7 sd #near infrared in greenchannel.

#there is a big contrast between cloud and rocks. there is more variability
#those parts have the highest variabaility
#this might indicate high geological variability or species variability
#here there is rock so high variability in rocks
#high variability =high species living in those region
#we chose nir for calculation
#how to choose the layer to apply standard deviation
#is by selecting multivariate analysis and apply it to the image
